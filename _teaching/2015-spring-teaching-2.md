I am a Graduate Assistant for Water: An Interdisciplanary Study. My role as Graduate Assistant is to lead several weekly laboratory sections, which corresponded to the students' weekly lectures. This course fulfills the science and laboratory skills distribution requirement for UMBC undergraduates in non-science degree programs. As such, the laboratory portion covers a substantial amount of basic scientific concepts and lab skills, from proper lab ettiquette to critical thinking and scientific writing. For their final output, students are required to design, execute, and report on their very own field experiment.
