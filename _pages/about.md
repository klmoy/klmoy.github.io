Hi, my name is Kari! You've stumbled upon my professional website. As you explore this website, you'll learn more about my professional journey, including my educational background, experience, and expertise in GIS.

A little more about me: I obtained my B.S. in Ecology, Evolution, and Natural Resources from Rutgers University, where discovered my love of dendrology, fieldwork, and environmental education. Building on these passions, I spent several years after Rutgers exploring different avenues for engaging with local communities in impactful ways. This work included gardening internships, teaching environmental programs, and working on ecological field research. I am currently a Master's student in GIS at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. At UMBC I've focused on my interests in data visualization and critical cartography. While my main objective is to apply my GIS skills to ecological research, the UMBC program has widened the scope of my professional interests to now include the intersection of climate change and social inequities.

I am dedicated to utilizing publically accessible data to improve data transparency and elucidate statistical patterns in simple, but elegant visulizations. I aim to communicate complicated information in clear and meaningful ways. Whether you're looking for help with cartographic design, statistical analysis, or scientific writing, I am committed to helping you achieve your goals and make an impact in your field. Browse through this website to learn more about Kari's services and resources, and how they can help you reach your full potential in GIS.
