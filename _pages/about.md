Hi, my name is Kari! This website. As you explore this website highlights my professional journey, including my educational background, experience, and expertise in GIS.

A little more about me: I hail from New Jersey, which despite its reputation, is not all highways and corporate campuses. Growing up in the Garden State fostered my curiosity for the natural world. I've explored from the northwest highlands to the southern coastal plains, learning from guidebooks, professors, and local experts along the way. If you ask me, this state is highly misunderstood and underrated ...but I digress. Throughout my childhood I was encouraged to express my creativity through the arts, which manifested into series of scientific illustrations.

Education: I obtained my B.S. in Ecology, Evolution, and Natural Resources from Rutgers University, where discovered my love of dendrology, fieldwork, and environmental education. Building on these passions, I spent several years after Rutgers exploring different avenues for engaging with local communities in impactful ways. This work included gardening internships, teaching environmental programs, and working on ecological field research. What I realized is that I am a science communicator at heart. I am currently a Master's student in GIS at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. At UMBC I've honed in on my interests in data visualization and critical cartography. While my main objective is to apply my GIS skills to ecological research, the UMBC program has widened the scope of my professional interests to now include the intersection of climate change and social inequities.

Professional Goals: I am dedicated to utilizing publically accessible data to improve data transparency and elucidate statistical patterns in simple, but elegant visulizations. I believe science is for everyone and that starts with being able to communicate complicated information in clear and meaningful ways. Whether you're looking for help with cartographic design, statistical analysis, or scientific writing, I am committed to helping you achieve your goals and empower people to make informed decisions.
