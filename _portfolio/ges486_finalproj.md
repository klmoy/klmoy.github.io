<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<br>
Biological stream health is an excellent indicator of environmental contamination as many species are not highly adapted to pollution. Stream health assessments have long been performed by citizen scientists, trained by professionals, thus this data is extensive and aids in the promotion of environmental stewardship. Using biological stream health data compiled by Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reports, I performed a spatial statistical analysis to test the relationship between stream health and the presence of chemical facilities. This exploratory analysis will serve as a framework for analytical replication in other areas that are included in the EPA TRI and stream health datasets.
