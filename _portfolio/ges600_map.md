*COVID and Diversity in NYC Small Multiples – This series of bivariate maps depicts positive COVId-19 cases reported in the NYC-5 borough region as it relates to the diversity index per census tract. Data was obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau. Each quadrant shows a bivariate category where there are high or low occurrences of diversity and positive COVId cases. For example, the ‘High-Low’ quadrant represents tracts where there is a high occurrence of diversity and a low occurrence of covid cases.*
